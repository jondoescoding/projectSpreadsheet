ðŸ¦œ Langchain script that reads emails and uploads transaction data to google spreadsheet.

In Jamaica we don't have any services similar to [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) which can allow our developers to link their apps to retrieve our banking information.

With this in mind I built a simple langchain script for the bank I primarily use day-to-day called National Commercial Bank (NCB) to read the email receipts they send to me on my transactions and upload the data to a google spreadsheet.
